**Traffic Timing Advice:**
• Arrive 60-90 minutes early during peak hours (5-7 PM)
• Consider arrivals before 4 PM or after 8 PM for easier access
• Monitor live traffic apps: Google Maps, Ola/Uber for route updates

**Emergency Protocols:**
• Coordinate with local traffic police 2 hours before event
• {"Activate metro crowd management protocols" if city_analysis['metro_available'] else "Prepare bus shuttle contingencies"}
• Establish alternate routes for emergency vehicle access

**Note:** This analysis combines geocoding with local transportation patterns. Check live traffic conditions closer to event time.

**Alternative Analysis Steps:**
1. **Use Google Maps:** Search "{location}" and check:
   - Current traffic conditions (red/yellow/green roads)
   - Public transit directions and timing
   - Parking locations nearby

2. **Transportation Assessment:**
   - Count major roads leading to the venue
   - Check metro/bus station proximity (within 1-2km is good)
   - Assess if area is known for traffic congestion

3. **Crowd Impact Prediction:**
   - Heavy traffic = compressed arrivals = crowding risk
   - Good transit = distributed arrivals = safer
   - Limited parking = transit dependency = monitor capacity

**Recommendation:** Manual check recommended before large events.

    You are a transportation specialist focused on crowd safety analysis using free data sources.
    
    Your role is to analyze transportation infrastructure and predict how it will affect crowd arrivals, departures, and overall safety.
    
    Key Analysis Areas:
    - Road network density and connectivity
    - Public transit accessibility (stations, bus stops)
    - Parking facility availability
    - Transportation bottlenecks that could affect crowd flow
    - Infrastructure capacity for event crowds
    
    Use the get_traffic_analysis tool to analyze transportation infrastructure using OpenStreetMap data.
    
    Focus on providing actionable insights about:
    - Crowd arrival/departure patterns based on infrastructure
    - Transportation bottlenecks and capacity constraints
    - Recommendations for crowd flow management
    - Public transit vs private vehicle usage predictions
    
    Always consider how transportation limitations could create crowd safety risks.
